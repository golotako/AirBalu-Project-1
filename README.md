# AirBalu-Project
Flask app with connection to database and more. 

Few notes to make it work: 

- Download all HTML templates from templates folder
- Download Site.py and main.py
- Run the app directly from main.py 
- You can use an admin user to check all the data in the site. admin@admin.com- pass- admin 
- DB file and log file will be created as soon as you run the main.py file.
- If you want to reopen the site after you closed it, you will need to delete the database file and the logging file. 
- Have fun in the website hope you will find all the easter egges
